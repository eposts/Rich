openssh (1:5.3p1-3ubuntu2) lucid; urgency=low

  * Always set child processes' OOM adjustment to 0, since Upstart will have
    set sshd's OOM adjustment on startup and so simply restoring the startup
    value won't work (LP: #293000).  Thanks to Karsten Suehring for
    analysis.
  * Limit automatic respawning to 10 times in 5 seconds (thanks to Fumihito
    YOSHIDA for the suggestion; LP: #533352).

  * Resynchronise with Debian.  Remaining changes:
    - Add support for registering ConsoleKit sessions on login.
    - Drop openssh-blacklist and openssh-blacklist-extra to Suggests; they
      take up a lot of CD space, and I suspect that rolling them out in
      security updates has covered most affected systems now.
    - Convert to Upstart.  The init script is still here for the benefit of
      people running sshd in chroots.
    - Install apport hook.

  * Update to GSSAPI patch from
    http://www.sxw.org.uk/computing/patches/openssh-5.3p1-gsskex-all-20100124.patch.
  * Backport from upstream:
    - Do not fall back to adding keys without constraints (ssh-add -c / -t
      ...) when the agent refuses the constrained add request. This was a
      useful migration measure back in 2002 when constraints were new, but
      just adds risk now (LP: #209447).
  * Drop change from 1:3.8p1-3 to avoid setresuid() and setresgid() system
    calls.  This only applied to Linux 2.2, which it's no longer feasible to
    run anyway (see 1:5.2p1-2 changelog).

openssh (1:5.2p1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Backport from upstream:
    - After sshd receives a SIGHUP, ignore subsequent HUPs while sshd
      re-execs itself.  Prevents two HUPs in quick succession from resulting
      in sshd dying (LP: #497781).
    - Output a debug if we can't open an existing keyfile (LP: #505301).
  * Use host compiler for ssh-askpass-gnome when cross-compiling.
  * Don't run tests when cross-compiling.
  * Drop change from 1:3.6.1p2-5 to disable cmsg_type check for file
    descriptor passing when running on Linux 2.0.  The previous stable
    release of Debian dropped support for Linux 2.4, let alone 2.0, so this
    very likely has no remaining users depending on it.

  [ Kees Cook ]
  * Implement DebianBanner server configuration flag that can be set to "no"
    to allow sshd to run without the Debian-specific extra version in the
    initial protocol handshake (closes: #562048).

  * Convert to Upstart. The init script is still here for the benefit of
    people running sshd in chroots. Note that the Upstart job does not
    support /etc/default/ssh, because it's much more straightforward to edit
    the job (/etc/init/ssh.conf) than it was to edit the init script.

openssh (1:5.2p1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #536182). Yes, I know 5.3p1 has been out
    for a while, but there's no GSSAPI patch available for it yet.
    - Change the default cipher order to prefer the AES CTR modes and the
      revised "arcfour256" mode to CBC mode ciphers that are susceptible to
      CPNI-957037 "Plaintext Recovery Attack Against SSH".
    - Add countermeasures to mitigate CPNI-957037-style attacks against the
      SSH protocol's use of CBC-mode ciphers. Upon detection of an invalid
      packet length or Message Authentication Code, ssh/sshd will continue
      reading up to the maximum supported packet length rather than
      immediately terminating the connection. This eliminates most of the
      known differences in behaviour that leaked information about the
      plaintext of injected data which formed the basis of this attack
      (closes: #506115, LP: #379329).
    - ForceCommand directive now accepts commandline arguments for the
      internal-sftp server (closes: #524423, LP: #362511).
    - Add AllowAgentForwarding to available Match keywords list (closes:
      #540623).
    - Make ssh(1) send the correct channel number for
      SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_SUCCESS and SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_FAILURE messages to
      avoid triggering 'Non-public channel' error messages on sshd(8) in
      openssh-5.1.
    - Avoid printing 'Non-public channel' warnings in sshd(8), since the
      ssh(1) has sent incorrect channel numbers since ~2004 (this reverts a
      behaviour introduced in openssh-5.1; closes: #496017).
    - Disable nonfunctional ssh(1) ~C escape handler in multiplex slave
      connections (closes: #507541).
    - Fix "whitepsace" typo in ssh_config(5) (closes: #514313, LP: #303835).
  * Update to GSSAPI patch from
    http://www.sxw.org.uk/computing/patches/openssh-5.2p1-gsskex-all-20090726.patch,
    including cascading credentials support (LP: #416958).
  * Use x11.pc when compiling/linking gnome-ssh-askpass2 (closes: #555951).
  * Moved to bzr.debian.org; add Vcs-Bzr and Vcs-Browser control fields.
  * Add debian/README.source with instructions on bzr handling.
  * Make ChrootDirectory work with SELinux (thanks, Russell Coker; closes:
    #556644).
  * Initialise sc to NULL in ssh_selinux_getctxbyname (thanks, Václav Ovsík;
    closes: #498684).
  * Don't duplicate backslashes when displaying server banner (thanks,
    Michał Górny; closes: #505378, LP: #425346).
  * Use hardening-includes for hardening logic (thanks, Kees Cook; closes:
    #561887).
  * Update OpenSSH FAQ to revision 1.110.
  * Remove ssh/new_config, only needed for direct upgrades from potato which
    are no longer particularly feasible anyway (closes: #420682).
  * Cope with insserv reordering of init script links.
  * Remove init script stop link in rc1, as killprocs handles it already.
  * Adjust short descriptions to avoid relying on previous experience with
    rsh, based on suggestions from Reuben Thomas (closes: #512198).
  * Remove manual page references to login.conf, which aren't applicable on
    non-BSD systems (closes: #154434).
  * Remove/adjust manual page references to BSD-specific /etc/rc (closes:
    #513417).
  * Refer to sshd_config(5) rather than sshd(8) in postinst-written
    /etc/ssh/sshd_config, and add UsePAM commentary from upstream-shipped
    configuration file (closes: #415008, although unfortunately this will
    only be conveniently visible on new installations).
  * Include URL to OpenBSD's ssl(8) in ssh(1), since I don't see a better
    source for the same information among Debian's manual pages (closes:
    #530692, LP: #456660).

  * Backport from upstream CVS (Markus Friedl):
    - packet_disconnect() on padding error, too. Should reduce the success
      probability for the CPNI-957037 Plaintext Recovery Attack to 2^-18.
  * Check that /var/run/sshd.pid exists and that the process ID listed there
    corresponds to sshd before running '/etc/init.d/ssh reload' from if-up
    script; SIGHUP is racy if called at boot before sshd has a chance to
    install its signal handler, but fortunately the pid file is written
    after that which lets us avoid the race (closes: #502444).
  * While the above is a valuable sanity-check, it turns out that it doesn't
    really fix the bug (thanks to Kevin Price for testing), so for the
    meantime we'll just use '/etc/init.d/ssh restart', even though it is
    unfortunately heavyweight.

openssh (1:5.1p1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #474301). Important changes not previously
    backported to 4.7p1:
    - 4.9/4.9p1 (http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-4.9):
      + Added chroot(2) support for sshd(8), controlled by a new option
        "ChrootDirectory" (closes: #139047, LP: #24777).
      + Linked sftp-server(8) into sshd(8). The internal sftp server is used
        when the command "internal-sftp" is specified in a Subsystem or
        ForceCommand declaration. When used with ChrootDirectory, the
        internal sftp server requires no special configuration of files
        inside the chroot environment.
      + Added a protocol extension method "posix-rename@openssh.com" for
        sftp-server(8) to perform POSIX atomic rename() operations; sftp(1)
        prefers this if available (closes: #308561).
      + Removed the fixed limit of 100 file handles in sftp-server(8).
      + ssh(8) will now skip generation of SSH protocol 1 ephemeral server
        keys when in inetd mode and protocol 2 connections are negotiated.
        This speeds up protocol 2 connections to inetd-mode servers that
        also allow Protocol 1.
      + Accept the PermitRootLogin directive in a sshd_config(5) Match
        block. Allows for, e.g. permitting root only from the local network.
      + Reworked sftp(1) argument splitting and escaping to be more
        internally consistent (i.e. between sftp commands) and more
        consistent with sh(1). Please note that this will change the
        interpretation of some quoted strings, especially those with
        embedded backslash escape sequences.
      + Support "Banner=none" in sshd_config(5) to disable sending of a
        pre-login banner (e.g. in a Match block).
      + ssh(1) ProxyCommands are now executed with $SHELL rather than
        /bin/sh.
      + ssh(1)'s ConnectTimeout option is now applied to both the TCP
        connection and the SSH banner exchange (previously it just covered
        the TCP connection). This allows callers of ssh(1) to better detect
        and deal with stuck servers that accept a TCP connection but don't
        progress the protocol, and also makes ConnectTimeout useful for
        connections via a ProxyCommand.
      + scp(1) incorrectly reported "stalled" on slow copies (closes:
        #140828).
      + scp(1) date underflow for timestamps before epoch.
      + ssh(1) used the obsolete SIG DNS RRtype for host keys in DNS,
        instead of the current standard RRSIG.
      + Correctly drain ACKs when a sftp(1) upload write fails midway,
        avoids a fatal() exit from what should be a recoverable condition.
      + Fixed ssh-keygen(1) selective host key hashing (i.e. "ssh-keygen -HF
        hostname") to not include any IP address in the data to be hashed.
      + Make ssh(1) skip listening on the IPv6 wildcard address when a
        binding address of 0.0.0.0 is used against an old SSH server that
        does not support the RFC4254 syntax for wildcard bind addresses.
      + Enable IPV6_V6ONLY socket option on sshd(8) listen socket, as is
        already done for X11/TCP forwarding sockets (closes: #439661).
      + Fix FD leak that could hang a ssh(1) connection multiplexing master.
      + Make ssh(1) -q option documentation consistent with reality.
      + Fixed sshd(8) PAM support not calling pam_session_close(), or
        failing to call it with root privileges (closes: #372680).
      + Fix activation of OpenSSL engine support when requested in configure
        (LP: #119295).
      + Cache SELinux status earlier so we know if it's enabled after a
        chroot (LP: #237557).
    - 5.1/5.1p1 (http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-5.1):
      + Introduce experimental SSH Fingerprint ASCII Visualisation to ssh(1)
        and ssh-keygen(1). Visual fingerprint display is controlled by a new
        ssh_config(5) option "VisualHostKey". The intent is to render SSH
        host keys in a visual form that is amenable to easy recall and
        rejection of changed host keys.
      + sshd_config(5) now supports CIDR address/masklen matching in "Match
        address" blocks, with a fallback to classic wildcard matching.
      + sshd(8) now supports CIDR matching in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
        from="..." restrictions, also with a fallback to classic wildcard
        matching.
      + Added an extended test mode (-T) to sshd(8) to request that it write
        its effective configuration to stdout and exit. Extended test mode
        also supports the specification of connection parameters (username,
        source address and hostname) to test the application of
        sshd_config(5) Match rules. 
      + ssh(1) now prints the number of bytes transferred and the overall
        connection throughput for SSH protocol 2 sessions when in verbose
        mode (previously these statistics were displayed for protocol 1
        connections only).
      + sftp-server(8) now supports extension methods statvfs@openssh.com
        and fstatvfs@openssh.com that implement statvfs(2)-like operations.
      + sftp(1) now has a "df" command to the sftp client that uses the
        statvfs@openssh.com to produce a df(1)-like display of filesystem
        space and inode utilisation (requires statvfs@openssh.com support on
        the server).
      + Added a MaxSessions option to sshd_config(5) to allow control of the
        number of multiplexed sessions supported over a single TCP
        connection. This allows increasing the number of allowed sessions
        above the previous default of 10, disabling connection multiplexing
        (MaxSessions=1) or disallowing login/shell/subsystem sessions
        entirely (MaxSessions=0).
      + Added a no-more-sessions@openssh.com global request extension that
        is sent from ssh(1) to sshd(8) when the client knows that it will
        never request another session (i.e. when session multiplexing is
        disabled). This allows a server to disallow further session requests
        and terminate the session in cases where the client has been
        hijacked.
      + ssh-keygen(1) now supports the use of the -l option in combination
        with -F to search for a host in ~/.ssh/known_hosts and display its
        fingerprint.
      + ssh-keyscan(1) now defaults to "rsa" (protocol 2) keys, instead of
        "rsa1" (LP: #129794).
      + Added an AllowAgentForwarding option to sshd_config(8) to control
        whether authentication agent forwarding is permitted. Note that this
        is a loose control, as a client may install their own unofficial
        forwarder.
      + ssh(1) and sshd(8): avoid unnecessary malloc/copy/free when
        receiving network data, resulting in a ~10% speedup.
      + ssh(1) and sshd(8) will now try additional addresses when connecting
        to a port forward destination whose DNS name resolves to more than
        one address. The previous behaviour was to try the only first
        address and give up if that failed.
      + ssh(1) and sshd(8) now support signalling that channels are
        half-closed for writing, through a channel protocol extension
        notification "eow@openssh.com". This allows propagation of closed
        file descriptors, so that commands such as "ssh -2 localhost od
        /bin/ls | true" do not send unnecessary data over the wire.
      + sshd(8): increased the default size of ssh protocol 1 ephemeral keys
        from 768 to 1024 bits.
      + When ssh(1) has been requested to fork after authentication ("ssh
        -f") with ExitOnForwardFailure enabled, delay the fork until after
        replies for any -R forwards have been seen. Allows for robust
        detection of -R forward failure when using -f.
      + "Match group" blocks in sshd_config(5) now support negation of
        groups. E.g. "Match group staff,!guests".
      + sftp(1) and sftp-server(8) now allow chmod-like operations to set
        set[ug]id/sticky bits.
      + The MaxAuthTries option is now permitted in sshd_config(5) match
        blocks.
      + Multiplexed ssh(1) sessions now support a subset of the ~ escapes
        that are available to a primary connection.
      + ssh(1) connection multiplexing will now fall back to creating a new
        connection in most error cases (closes: #352830).
      + Make ssh(1) deal more gracefully with channel requests that fail.
        Previously it would optimistically assume that requests would always
        succeed, which could cause hangs if they did not (e.g. when the
        server runs out of file descriptors).
      + ssh(1) now reports multiplexing errors via the multiplex slave's
        stderr where possible (subject to LogLevel in the mux master).
      + Fixed an UMAC alignment problem that manifested on Itanium
        platforms.

openssh (1:4.7p1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #453367).
    - CVE-2007-4752: Prevent ssh(1) from using a trusted X11 cookie if
      creation of an untrusted cookie fails; found and fixed by Jan Pechanec
      (closes: #444738).
    - sshd(8) in new installations defaults to SSH Protocol 2 only. Existing
      installations are unchanged.
    - The SSH channel window size has been increased, and both ssh(1)
      sshd(8) now send window updates more aggressively. These improves
      performance on high-BDP (Bandwidth Delay Product) networks.
    - ssh(1) and sshd(8) now preserve MAC contexts between packets, which
      saves 2 hash calls per packet and results in 12-16% speedup for
      arcfour256/hmac-md5.
    - A new MAC algorithm has been added, UMAC-64 (RFC4418) as
      "umac-64@openssh.com". UMAC-64 has been measured to be approximately
      20% faster than HMAC-MD5.
    - Failure to establish a ssh(1) TunnelForward is now treated as a fatal
      error when the ExitOnForwardFailure option is set.
    - ssh(1) returns a sensible exit status if the control master goes away
      without passing the full exit status.
    - When using a ProxyCommand in ssh(1), set the outgoing hostname with
      gethostname(2), allowing hostbased authentication to work.
    - Make scp(1) skip FIFOs rather than hanging (closes: #246774).
    - Encode non-printing characters in scp(1) filenames. These could cause
      copies to be aborted with a "protocol error".
    - Handle SIGINT in sshd(8) privilege separation child process to ensure
      that wtmp and lastlog records are correctly updated.
    - Report GSSAPI mechanism in errors, for libraries that support multiple
      mechanisms.
    - Improve documentation for ssh-add(1)'s -d option.
    - Rearrange and tidy GSSAPI code, removing server-only code being linked
      into the client.
    - Delay execution of ssh(1)'s LocalCommand until after all forwardings
      have been established.
    - In scp(1), do not truncate non-regular files.
    - Improve exit message from ControlMaster clients.
    - Prevent sftp-server(8) from reading until it runs out of buffer space,
      whereupon it would exit with a fatal error (closes: #365541).
    - pam_end() was not being called if authentication failed
      (closes: #405041).
    - Manual page datestamps updated (closes: #433181).
  * Install the OpenSSH FAQ in /usr/share/doc/openssh-client.
    - Includes documentation on copying files with colons using scp
      (closes: #303453).
  * Create /var/run/sshd on start even if /etc/ssh/sshd_not_to_be_run exists
    (closes: #453285).
  * Fix "overriden" typo in ssh(1) (thanks, A. Costa; closes: #390699).
  * Refactor debian/rules configure and make invocations to make development
    easier.
  * Remove the hideously old /etc/ssh/primes on upgrade (closes: #123013).
  * Update moduli(5) to revision 1.11 from OpenBSD CVS.
  * Document the non-default options we set as standard in ssh_config(5) and
    sshd_config(5) (closes: #327886, #345628).
  * Recode LICENCE to UTF-8 when concatenating it to debian/copyright.
  * Override desktop-file-but-no-dh_desktop-call lintian warning; the
    .desktop file is intentionally not installed (see 1:3.8.1p1-10).
  * Update copyright dates for Kerberos patch in debian/copyright.head.

    - Move C/R -> kbdint special case to after the defaults have been
      loaded, which makes ChallengeResponse default to yes again. This was
      broken by the Match changes and not fixed properly subsequently

openssh (1:4.6p1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #395507, #397961, #420035). Important
    changes not previously backported to 4.3p2:
    - 4.4/4.4p1 (http://www.openssh.org/txt/release-4.4):
      + On portable OpenSSH, fix a GSSAPI authentication abort that could be
        used to determine the validity of usernames on some platforms.
      + Implemented conditional configuration in sshd_config(5) using the
        "Match" directive. This allows some configuration options to be
        selectively overridden if specific criteria (based on user, group,
        hostname and/or address) are met. So far a useful subset of
        post-authentication options are supported and more are expected to
        be added in future releases.
      + Add support for Diffie-Hellman group exchange key agreement with a
        final hash of SHA256.
      + Added a "ForceCommand" directive to sshd_config(5). Similar to the
        command="..." option accepted in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, this forces
        the execution of the specified command regardless of what the user
        requested. This is very useful in conjunction with the new "Match"
        option.
      + Add a "PermitOpen" directive to sshd_config(5). This mirrors the
        permitopen="..." authorized_keys option, allowing fine-grained
        control over the port-forwardings that a user is allowed to
        establish.
      + Add optional logging of transactions to sftp-server(8).
      + ssh(1) will now record port numbers for hosts stored in
        ~/.ssh/known_hosts when a non-standard port has been requested
        (closes: #50612).
      + Add an "ExitOnForwardFailure" option to cause ssh(1) to exit (with a
        non-zero exit code) when requested port forwardings could not be
        established.
      + Extend sshd_config(5) "SubSystem" declarations to allow the
        specification of command-line arguments.
      + Replacement of all integer overflow susceptible invocations of
        malloc(3) and realloc(3) with overflow-checking equivalents.
      + Many manpage fixes and improvements.
      + Add optional support for OpenSSL hardware accelerators (engines),
        enabled using the --with-ssl-engine configure option.
      + Tokens in configuration files may be double-quoted in order to
        contain spaces (closes: #319639).
      + Move a debug() call out of a SIGCHLD handler, fixing a hang when the
        session exits very quickly (closes: #307890).
      + Fix some incorrect buffer allocation calculations (closes: #410599).
      + ssh-add doesn't ask for a passphrase if key file permissions are too
        liberal (closes: #103677).
      + Likewise, ssh doesn't ask either (closes: #99675).
    - 4.6/4.6p1 (http://www.openssh.org/txt/release-4.6):
      + sshd now allows the enabling and disabling of authentication methods
        on a per user, group, host and network basis via the Match directive
        in sshd_config.
      + Fixed an inconsistent check for a terminal when displaying scp
        progress meter (closes: #257524).
      + Fix "hang on exit" when background processes are running at the time
        of exit on a ttyful/login session (closes: #88337).
  * Update to current GSSAPI patch from
    http://www.sxw.org.uk/computing/patches/openssh-4.6p1-gsskex-20070312.patch;
    install ChangeLog.gssapi.
  * Build the .deb --with-ssl-engine (closes: #408027, LP: #119295).
  * Use LSB functions in init scripts, and add an LSB-style header (partly
    from Ubuntu and partly thanks to Christian Perrier; closes: #389038).
  * Move init script start links to S16, move rc1 stop link to K84, and
    remove rc0 and rc6 stop links altogether (the last part from Ubuntu;
    closes: #122188).
  * Emit a slightly more informative message from the init script if
    /dev/null has somehow become not a character device (closes: #369964).
  * Belatedly build-depend on zlib1g-dev (>= 1:1.2.3-1) (closes: #333447).
  * Merge from Ubuntu:
    - Build position-independent executables (only for debs, not for udebs)
      to take advantage of address space layout randomisation.
    - If building on Ubuntu, add /sbin, /usr/sbin, and /usr/local/sbin to
      the default path.
  * Use ${binary:Version} rather than ${Source-Version} in openssh-server ->
    openssh-client dependency.

openssh (1:4.3p2-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * It's been four and a half years now since I took over as "temporary"

  [ Vincent Untz ]
  * Give the ssh-askpass-gnome window a default icon; remove unnecessary
    icon extension from .desktop file (closes:

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Drop versioning on ssh/ssh-krb5 Replaces, as otherwise it isn't
    sufficient to replace conffiles (closes: #402804).
  * Make GSSAPICleanupCreds a compatibility alias for
    GSSAPICleanupCredentials. Mark GSSUseSessionCCache and
    GSSAPIUseSessionCredCache as known-but-unsupported options, and migrate
    away from them on upgrade.
  * It turns out that the people who told me that removing a conffile in the
    preinst was sufficient to have dpkg replace it without prompting when
    moving a conffile between packages were very much mistaken. As far as I
    can tell, the only way to do this reliably is to write out the desired
    new text of the conffile in the preinst. This is gross, and requires
    shipping the text of all conffiles in the preinst too, but there's
    nothing for it. Fortunately this nonsense is only required for smooth
    upgrades from sarge.
  * debconf template translations:
    - Add Romanian (thanks, Stan Ioan-Eugen; closes: #403528).

openssh (1:4.3p2-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Backport from 4.4p1 (since I don't have an updated version of the GSSAPI
    patch yet):
    - CVE-2006-4924: Fix a pre-authentication denial of service found by
      Tavis Ormandy, that would cause sshd(8) to spin until the login grace
      time expired (closes: #389995).
    - CVE-2006-5051: Fix an unsafe signal hander reported by Mark Dowd. The
      signal handler was vulnerable to a race condition that could be
      exploited to perform a pre-authentication denial of service. On
      portable OpenSSH, this vulnerability could theoretically lead to
      pre-authentication remote code execution if GSSAPI authentication is
      enabled, but the likelihood of successful exploitation appears remote.

  * Read /etc/default/locale as well as /etc/environment (thanks, Raphaël
    Hertzog; closes: #369395).
  * Remove no-longer-used ssh/insecure_rshd debconf template.
  * Make ssh/insecure_telnetd Type: error (closes: #388946).

openssh (1:4.3p2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #361032).
    - CVE-2006-0225: scp (as does rcp, on which it is based) invoked a
      subshell to perform local to local, and remote to remote copy
      operations. This subshell exposed filenames to shell expansion twice;
      allowing a local attacker to create filenames containing shell
      metacharacters that, if matched by a wildcard, could lead to execution
      of attacker-specified commands with the privilege of the user running
      scp (closes: #349645).
    - Add support for tunneling arbitrary network packets over a connection
      between an OpenSSH client and server via tun(4) virtual network
      interfaces. This allows the use of OpenSSH (4.3+) to create a true VPN
      between the client and server providing real network connectivity at
      layer 2 or 3. This feature is experimental.
    - Reduce default key length for new DSA keys generated by ssh-keygen
      back to 1024 bits. DSA is not specified for longer lengths and does
      not fully benefit from simply making keys longer. As per FIPS 186-2
      Change Notice 1, ssh-keygen will refuse to generate a new DSA key
      smaller or larger than 1024 bits.
    - Fixed X forwarding failing to start when the X11 client is executed in
      background at the time of session exit.
    - Change ssh-keygen to generate a protocol 2 RSA key when invoked
      without arguments (closes: #114894).
    - Fix timing variance for valid vs. invalid accounts when attempting
      Kerberos authentication.
    - Ensure that ssh always returns code 255 on internal error
      (closes: #259865).
    - Cleanup wtmp files on SIGTERM when not using privsep.
    - Set SO_REUSEADDR on X11 listeners to avoid problems caused by
      lingering sockets from previous session (X11 applications can
      sometimes not connect to 127.0.0.1:60xx) (closes:
      https://launchpad.net/bugs/25528).
    - Ensure that fds 0, 1 and 2 are always attached in all programs, by
      duping /dev/null to them if necessary.
    - Xauth list invocation had bogus "." argument.
    - Remove internal assumptions on key exchange hash algorithm and output
      length, preparing OpenSSH for KEX methods with alternate hashes.
    - Ignore junk sent by a server before it sends the "SSH-" banner.
    - Many manual page improvements.
    - Lots of cleanups, including fixes to memory leaks on error paths and
      possible crashes.
  * Update to current GSSAPI patch from
    http://www.sxw.org.uk/computing/patches/openssh-4.3p2-gsskex-20060223.patch
    (closes: #352042).
  * debian/rules: Resynchronise CFLAGS with that generated by configure.
  * Restore pam_nologin to /etc/pam.d/ssh; sshd no longer checks this itself
    when PAM is enabled, but relies on PAM to do it.
  * Rename KeepAlive to TCPKeepAlive in default sshd_config
    (closes: #349896).
  * Rephrase ssh/new_config and ssh/encrypted_host_key_but_no_keygen debconf
    templates to make boolean short descriptions end with a question mark
    and to avoid use of the first person.
  * Ship README.tun.

openssh (1:4.2p1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a CVE name to the 1:4.0p1-1 changelog entry.
  * Build-depend on libselinux1-dev on armeb.
  * Only send GSSAPI proposal if GSSAPIAuthentication is enabled.
  * Build-depend on libssl-dev (>= 0.9.8-1) to cope with surprise OpenSSL
    transition, since otherwise who knows what the buildds will do. If
    you're building openssh yourself, you can safely ignore this and use an
    older libssl-dev.

  * Interoperate with ssh-krb5 << 3.8.1p1-1 servers, which used a slightly
    different version of the gssapi authentication method (thanks, Aaron M.
    Ucko; closes: #328388).
  * Explicitly tell po2debconf to use the 'popular' output encoding, so that
    the woody-compatibility hack works even with po-debconf 0.9.0.

    - Add GSSAPI key exchange support from
      http://www.sxw.org.uk/computing/patches/openssh.html (thanks, Stephen
      Frost).
    - Build-depend on libkrb5-dev and configure --with-kerberos5=/usr.
    - openssh-client and openssh-server replace ssh-krb5.
    - Update commented-out Kerberos/GSSAPI options in default sshd_config.
    - Fix HAVE_GSSAPI_KRB5_H/HAVE_GSSAPI_GSSAPI_KRB5_H typos in

openssh (1:4.2p1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - SECURITY (CAN-2005-2797): Fix a bug introduced in OpenSSH 4.0 that
      caused GatewayPorts to be incorrectly activated for dynamic ("-D")
      port forwardings when no listen address was explicitly specified
      (closes: #326065).
    - SECURITY (CAN-2005-2798): Fix improper delegation of GSSAPI
      credentials. This code is only built in openssh-krb5, not openssh, but
      I mention the CVE reference here anyway for completeness.
    - Add a new compression method ("Compression delayed") that delays zlib
      compression until after authentication, eliminating the risk of zlib
      vulnerabilities being exploited by unauthenticated users. Note that
      users of OpenSSH versions earlier than 3.5 will need to disable
      compression on the client or set "Compression yes" (losing this
      security benefit) on the server.
    - Increase the default size of new RSA/DSA keys generated by ssh-keygen
      from 1024 to 2048 bits (closes: #181162).
    - Many bugfixes and improvements to connection multiplexing.
    - Don't pretend to accept $HOME (closes: #208648).
  * debian/rules: Resynchronise CFLAGS with that generated by configure.
  * openssh-client and openssh-server conflict with pre-split ssh to avoid
    problems when ssh is left un-upgraded (closes: #324695).
  * Set X11Forwarding to yes in the default sshd_config (new installs only).
    At least when X11UseLocalhost is turned on, which is the default, the
    security risks of using X11 forwarding are risks to the client, not to
    the server (closes: #320104).

openssh (1:4.1p1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Do the IDEA host key check on a temporary file to avoid altering
    /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key itself (closes: #312312).
  * Work around the ssh-askpass alternative somehow ending up in manual mode
    pointing to the obsolete /usr/lib/ssh/gnome-ssh-askpass.
  * Add GNU/kFreeBSD support (thanks, Aurelien Jarno; closes: #318113).
  * Fix XSIish uses of 'test' in openssh-server.preinst.
  * Policy version 3.6.2: no changes required.

openssh (1:4.1p1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-depend on libselinux1-dev on ppc64 too (closes: #314625).
  * Drop priority of ssh to extra to match the override file.
  * Make /usr/share/doc/openssh-server and /usr/share/doc/ssh symlinks to
    /usr/share/doc/openssh-client (closes: #314745).
  * Ship README.dns (closes: #284874).
  * Disable btmp logging, since Debian's /var/log/btmp has inappropriate
    permissions (closes: #314956).
  * Allow ~/.ssh/config to be group-writable, provided that the group in
    question contains only the file's owner (closes: #314347).
  * debconf template translations:
    - Update Brazilian Portuguese (thanks, André Luís Lopes;
      closes: #315477).
    - Add Vietnamese (thanks, Clytie Siddall; closes: #316636).

openssh (1:4.1p1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * openssh-client and openssh-server conflict with ssh-krb5, as ssh-krb5
    only conflicts with ssh (closes: #312475).
  * SELinux support (thanks, Manoj Srivastava; closes: #308555):
    - Added SELinux capability, and turned it on be default. Added
      restorecon calls in preinst and postinst (should not matter if the
      machine is not SELinux aware). By and large, the changes made should
      have no effect unless the rules file calls --with-selinux; and even
      then there should be no performance hit for machines not actively
      running SELinux.
    - Modified the preinst and postinst to call restorecon to set the
      security context for the generated public key files.
    - Added a comment to /etc/pam.d/ssh to indicate that an SELinux system
      may want to also include pam_selinux.so.
  * Re-enable ssh-askpass-gnome on the Hurd, now that its build-dependencies
    are available.
  * Restore /usr/lib/sftp-server temporarily, as a symlink to
    /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server (closes: #312891).
  * Switch to debhelper compatibility level 3, since 2 is deprecated.
  * debconf template translations:
    - Update German (thanks, Jens Seidel; closes: #313949).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon,  6 Jun 2005 22:28:33 +0100

openssh (1:4.1p1-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Drop debconf support for allowing SSH protocol 1, which is discouraged
    and has not been the default since openssh 1:3.0.1p1-1. Users who need
    this should edit sshd_config instead (closes: #147212).
  * Since ssh-keysign isn't used by default (you need to set
    EnableSSHKeysign to "yes" in /etc/ssh/ssh_config), having a debconf
    question to ask whether it should be setuid is overkill, and the
    question text had got out of date anyway. Remove this question, ship
    ssh-keysign setuid in openssh-client.deb, and set a statoverride if the
    debconf question was previously set to false.
  * Add lintian overrides for the above (setuid-binary,
    no-debconf-templates).
  * Fix picky lintian errors about slogin symlinks.
  * Fix DEB_HOST_ARCH_OS/DEB_HOST_GNU_SYSTEM compatibility handling.
  * Apply Linux 2.2 workaround (see #239999) only on Linux.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Thu,  2 Jun 2005 00:55:58 +0100

openssh (1:4.1p1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Normalise socket addresses returned by get_remote_hostname(), fixing
      4-in-6 mapping issues with AllowUsers et al (closes: #192234).
  * Take upstream's hint and disable the unsupported USE_POSIX_THREADS
    (closes: #295757, #308868, and possibly others; may open other bugs).
    Use PAM password authentication to avoid #278394. In future I may
    provide two sets of binaries built with and without this option, since
    it seems I can't win.
  * Disable ChallengeResponseAuthentication in new installations, returning
    to PasswordAuthentication by default, since it now supports PAM and
    apparently works better with a non-threaded sshd (closes: #247521).
  * openssh-server Suggests: rssh (closes: #233012).
  * Change libexecdir to /usr/lib/openssh, and fix up various alternatives
    and configuration files to match (closes: #87900, #151321).
  * Fix up very old sshd_config files that refer to /usr/libexec/sftp-server
    (closes: #141979).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue, 31 May 2005 01:33:33 +0100

openssh (1:4.0p1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Port-forwarding specifications now take optional bind addresses, and
      the server allows client-specified bind addresses for remote port
      forwardings when configured with "GatewayPorts clientspecified"
      (closes: #87253, #192206).
    - ssh and ssh-keyscan now support hashing of known_hosts files for
      improved privacy (CAN-2005-2666). ssh-keygen has new options for
      managing known_hosts files, which understand hashing.
    - sftp supports command history and editing support using libedit
      (closes: #287013).
    - Have scp and sftp wait for the spawned ssh to exit before they exit
      themselves, allowing ssh to restore terminal modes (closes: #257130).
    - Improved the handling of bad data in authorized_keys files,
      eliminating fatal errors on corrupt or very large keys; e.g. linefeeds
      in keys only produce errors in auth.log now (closes: #220726).
    - Add "command mode" to ssh connection multiplexing (closes: #303452).
    - Mention $HOME/.hushlogin in sshd(8) FILES section (closes: #163933).
  * Make gnome-ssh-askpass stay above other windows (thanks, Liyang HU;
    closes: #296487).
  * Remove obsolete and unnecessary ssh/forward_warning debconf note.
  * Hurd build fixes (although sshd still doesn't work):
    - Restore X forwarding fix from #102991, lost somewhere along the way.
    - Link with -lcrypt.
    - Link with -lpthread rather than -pthread.
    - Don't build ssh-askpass-gnome on the Hurd, until GNOME is available to
      satisfy build-dependencies.
  * Drop workaround for #242462 on amd64; it's been fixed properly upstream.
  * Enable HashKnownHosts by default. This only affects new entries; use
    'ssh-keygen -H' to convert an entire known_hosts file to hashed format.
  * Note in ssh_config(5) that the SetupTimeOut option is Debian-specific
    (closes: #307069).
  * debconf template translations:
    - Update Czech (thanks, Miroslav Kure; closes: #298744).
    - Update Finnish (thanks, Matti Pöllä; closes: #303787).
    - Synchronise Spanish with sarge branch (thanks, Javier
      Fernández-Sanguino Peña; closes: #298536).
    - Add Ukrainian (thanks, Eugeniy Meshcheryakov; closes: #301852).

  * Depend on debconf | debconf-2.0.
  * Drop LoginGraceTime back to the upstream default of two minutes on new

    - Implemented the ability to pass selected environment variables between
      the client and the server.
    - Fix ssh-keyscan breakage when remote server doesn't speak SSH protocol
      (closes: #228828).
    - Fix res_query detection (closes: #242462).
    - 'ssh -c' documentation improved (closes: #265627).
  * Pass LANG and LC_* environment variables from the client by default, and
    accept them to the server by default in new installs, although not on
    upgrade (closes: #264024).
  * Build ssh in binary-indep, not binary-arch (thanks, LaMont Jones).
  * Expand on openssh-client package description (closes: #273831).

    1:3.8.1p1-8.sarge.1" to "OpenSSH_3.8.1p1 Debian-8.sarge.1", as some SSH

    This is of course a bug in those implementations, but since the extent

  * If PasswordAuthentication is disabled, then offer to disable
    ChallengeResponseAuthentication too. The current PAM code will attempt
    password-style authentication if ChallengeResponseAuthentication is
    enabled (closes: #250369).

  * Don't install the ssh-askpass-gnome .desktop file by default; I've had

    left it in /usr/share/doc/ssh-askpass-gnome/examples/ for now.

openssh (1:3.8.1p1-9) experimental; urgency=low

  * Split the ssh binary package into openssh-client and openssh-server
    (closes: #39741). openssh-server depends on openssh-client for some
    common functionality; it didn't seem worth creating yet another package
    for this. openssh-client is priority standard, openssh-server optional.
  * New transitional ssh package, priority optional, depending on
    openssh-client and openssh-server. May be removed once nothing depends
    on it.
  * When upgrading from ssh to openssh-{client,server}, it's very difficult
    for the maintainer scripts to find out what version we're upgrading from
    without dodgy dpkg hackery. I've therefore taken the opportunity to move
    a couple of debconf notes into NEWS files, namely ssh/ssh2_keys_merged
    and ssh/user_environment_tell.
  * Add a heuristic to try to make sure the sshd_config upgrade to >= 3.7
    happens even though we don't know what version we're upgrading from.
  * Remove /etc/ssh/sshd_not_to_be_run on purge of openssh-server. For now
    (until sarge+2) it's still honoured to avoid breaking existing
    configurations, but the right approach is now to remove the
    openssh-server package if you don't want to run the server. Add a NEWS
    item to that effect.

openssh (1:3.8.1p1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Use a longer buffer for tty names in utmp (closes: #247538).
  * Make sure there's a newline at the end of sshd_config before adding
    'UsePAM yes' (closes: #244829).
  * Generate a new .orig.tar.gz without RFC.nroff, and remove
    /usr/share/doc/ssh/RFC.gz (closes: #211640). It isn't DFSG-free and only
    documents the obsolete SSH1 protocol, not to mention that it was never a
    real RFC but only an Internet-Draft. It's available from
    http://www.free.lp.se/bamse/draft-ylonen-ssh-protocol-00.txt if you want
    it for some reason.
  * Add openssh-client-udeb and openssh-server-udeb binary packages for use
    in debian-installer. They still need libnss_files to be supplied in udeb
    form by glibc.
  * Work around lack of res_query weak alias in libresolv on amd64 (see
    #242462, awaiting real fix upstream).
  * Fix grammar in sshd(8) (closes: #238753).
  * Add .desktop file and icon for ssh-askpass-gnome (closes: #232333).
  * Update Polish debconf template translation (thanks, Emil Nowak;
    closes: #242808).
  * Add Turkish debconf template translation (thanks, Recai Oktaş;
    closes: #246068).

  * Remove deprecated ReverseMappingCheck option from newly generated
    sshd_config files (closes: #239987).
  * Build everything apart from contrib in a subdirectory, to allow for
    multiple builds.
  * Some older kernels are missing setresuid() and setresgid(), so don't try
    to use them. setreuid() and setregid() will do well enough for our
    purposes (closes: #239999).

openssh (1:3.8p1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Disable PasswordAuthentication for new installations (closes: #236810).
  * Turn off the new ForwardX11Trusted by default, returning to the
    semantics of 3.7 and earlier, since it seems immature and causes far too
    many problems with existing setups. See README.Debian for details
    (closes: #237021).

openssh (1:3.8p1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #232281):
    - New PAM implementation based on that in FreeBSD. This runs PAM session
      modules before dropping privileges (closes: #132681, #150968).
    - Since PAM session modules are run as root, we can turn pam_limits back
      on by default, and it no longer spits out "Operation not permitted" to
      syslog (closes: #171673).
    - Password expiry works again (closes: #153235).
    - 'ssh -q' suppresses login banner (closes: #134589).
    - sshd doesn't lie to PAM about invalid usernames (closes: #157078).
    - ssh-add prints key comment on each prompt (closes: #181869).
    - Punctuation formatting fixed in man pages (closes: #191131).
    - EnableSSHKeysign documented in ssh_config(5) (closes: #224457).
  * Add 'UsePAM yes' to /etc/ssh/sshd_config on upgrade from versions older
    than this, to maintain the standard Debian sshd configuration.
  * Comment out PAMAuthenticationViaKbdInt and RhostsAuthentication in
    sshd_config on upgrade. Neither option is supported any more.
  * Privilege separation and PAM are now properly supported together, so
    remove both debconf questions related to them and simply set it
    unconditionally in newly generated sshd_config files (closes: #228838).
  * ServerAliveInterval implemented upstream, so ProtocolKeepAlives is now a
    compatibility alias. The semantics differ slightly, though; see
    ssh_config(5) for details.
  * Implement SSH1 support for ServerAliveInterval using SSH_MSG_IGNORE. As
    documented in ssh_config(5), it's not as good as the SSH2 version.
  * Remove -fno-builtin-log, -DHAVE_MMAP_ANON_SHARED, and
    -D__FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 compiler options, which are no longer necessary.
  * Update config.guess and config.sub from autotools-dev 20040105.1.
  * Darren Tucker:
    - Reset signal status when starting pam auth thread, prevent hanging
      during PAM keyboard-interactive authentications.
    - Fix a non-security-critical segfault in PAM authentication.
  * Add debconf template translations:
    - Greek (thanks, Konstantinos Margaritis; closes: #232843).
    - Italian (thanks, Renato Gini; closes: #234777).

    - Spanish (thanks, Carlos Valdivia Yagüe; closes: #211832).
  * Add Dutch debconf template translation (thanks, cobaco;
    closes: #215372).
  * Update config.guess and config.sub from autotools-dev 20031007.1
    (closes: #217696).
  * Implement New World Order for PAM configuration, including
    /etc/pam.d/common-* from /etc/pam.d/ssh (closes: #212959).
    - To backport this release to woody, you need to set DEB_BUILD_SSH_WOODY
      in your environment. See README.Debian.
  * Add more commentary to /etc/pam.d/ssh.

  * Some small improvements to the English templates courtesy of Christian
    Perrier. I've manually unfuzzied a few translations where it was
    obvious, on Christian's advice, but the others will have to be updated.
  * Document how to generate an RSA1 host key (closes: #141703).

    privilege separation on 2.0 from ssh/privsep_ask and ssh/privsep_tell
    debconf questions and from README.Debian, since it should all now work.
  * Fix "defails" typo in generated sshd_config (closes: #206484).

  * Version the adduser dependency for --no-create-home (closes: #195756).
  * Add a version of moduli(5), namely revision 1.7 of

openssh (1:3.6.1p2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Force /etc/default/ssh to be non-executable, since dpkg apparently
    doesn't deal with permissions changes on conffiles (closes: #192966).
  * Use debconf 0.5's seen flag rather than the deprecated isdefault.
  * Add GPL location to copyright file.
  * Remove debian/postinst.old.
  * Switch to po-debconf, with some careful manual use of po2debconf to
    ensure that the source package continues to build smoothly on woody
    (closes: #183986).
  * Update debconf template translations:
    - Brazilian Portugese (thanks, Andre Luis Lopes; see #183986).
    - Japanese (thanks, Tomohiro KUBOTA; closes: #192429).
  * Compile with -fno-builtin-log for now, otherwise gcc-3.3 complains
    "log.h:59: warning: conflicting types for built-in function `log'". The
    OpenSSH log() function has been renamed in upstream CVS.

openssh (1:3.6.1p2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release, including fix for PAM user-discovery security hole
    (closes: #191681).
  * Fix ChallengeResponseAuthentication default in generated sshd_config
    (closes: #106037).
  * Put newlines after full stops in man page documentation for
    ProtocolKeepAlives and SetupTimeOut.
  * Policy version 3.5.9: support DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noopt, build
    gnome-ssh-askpass with -g and -Wall flags.
  * Really ask ssh/new_config debconf question before trying to fetch its
    value (closes: #188721).
  * On purge, remove only the files we know about in /etc/ssh rather than
    the whole thing, and remove the directory if that leaves it empty
    (closes: #176679).
  * ssh has depended on debconf for some time now with no complaints, so:
    - Simplify the postinst by relying on debconf being present. (The absent
      case was buggy anyway.)
    - Get rid of "if you have not installed debconf" text in README.Debian,
      and generally update the "/usr/bin/ssh not SUID" entry.
  * More README.Debian work:
    - Reorganize into "UPGRADE ISSUES" and "OTHER ISSUES", in an effort to
      make it easier for people to find the former. The upgrade issues
      should probably be sorted by version somehow.
    - Document X11UseLocalhost under "X11 Forwarding" (closes: #150913).
  * Fix setting of IP flags for interactive sessions (upstream bug #541).

  * New upstream release.
    - Workaround applied upstream for a bug in the interaction of glibc's
      getaddrinfo() with the Linux 2.2 kernel (closes: #155814).
    - As such, it should now be safe to remove --with-ipv4-default, so
      starting sshd with -6 is no longer necessary (closes: #79861 and lots
      of other merged bugs).
    - ssh-copy-id prints usage when run without arguments (closes: #71376).
    - scp exits 1 if ssh fails (closes: #138400).
    - sshd writes to utmp's ut_addr_v6 field in IPv6 mode (closes: #167867).
    - 'ssh-add -c' causes ssh-agent to ask the user each time a key is used
      (closes: #109795).
  * Install /etc/default/ssh non-executable (closes: #185537).

openssh (1:3.5p1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add /etc/default/ssh (closes: #161049).
  * Run the init script under 'set -e' (closes: #175010).
  * Change the default superuser path to include /sbin, /usr/sbin, and
    /usr/local/sbin (closes: #128235, #151267). Using login.defs would be
    nice, but that belongs to another package. Without a defined API to
    retrieve its settings, parsing it is off-limits.
  * Build ssh-askpass-gnome with GNOME 2. The source package should still
    support building on stable with GNOME 1, using the alternate
    libgnome-dev build-dependency (thanks, Colin Walters; closes: #167582).

openssh (1:3.5p1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Point rlogin and rcp alternatives at slogin and scp respectively rather
    than ssh (closes: #121103, #151666). Fix alternative removal to match;
    previously it was completely wrong anyway.
  * Find out whether /etc/ssh/sshd_not_to_be_run exists and set the debconf
    question's default using that information, rather than using debconf as
    a registry. Other solutions may be better in the long run, but this is
    at least correct (thanks, Matthew Woodcraft; closes: #84725).
  * Stop using pam_lastlog, as it doesn't currently work well as a session
    module when privilege separation is enabled; it can usually read
    /var/log/lastlog but can't write to it. Instead, just use sshd's
    built-in support, already enabled by default (closes: #151297, #169938).
  * Use 'ssh-keygen -q' rather than redirecting output to /dev/null.
  * Add a "this may take some time" warning when creating host keys on
    installation (part of #110094).
  * When restarting via the init script, check for sshd_not_to_be_run after
    stopping sshd (idea from Tomas Pospisek; closes: #149850).
  * Append /usr/sbin:/sbin to the init script's $PATH, just in case of
    strangeness (closes: #115138).
  * Fix a dpkg-statoverride call to redirect stdout to /dev/null, not
    stderr.
  * Correct copyright file typo: "orignal" -> "original" (closes: #176490).
  * Rebuild with libssl0.9.7 (closes: #176983).
  * We're up to policy version 3.5.6. DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS stuff still needs to
    be looked at.

  * Use getent rather than id to find out whether the sshd user exists

  * Remove some duplication from the postinst's ssh-keysign setuid code.
  * Replace db_text with db_input throughout debian/config. (db_text has
    been a compatibility wrapper since debconf 0.1.5.)
  * Warn about PermitUserEnvironment on upgrade (closes: #167895).
  * Use 'make install-nokeys', and disable unused debhelper commands,
    thereby forward-porting the last pieces of Zack Weinberg's patch
    (closes: #68341).
  * Move the man page for gnome-ssh-askpass from the ssh package to
    ssh-askpass-gnome (closes: #174449).
  * Build with -DLOGIN_NO_ENDOPT, since Debian's /bin/login doesn't accept
    '--' to terminate the list of options (closes: #171554).
  * Add Jonathan Amery's ssh-argv0 script (closes: #111341).
  * Update Danish debconf template (thanks, Morten Brix Pedersen;
    closes: #174757).
  * Document setgid ssh-agent's effect on certain environment variables in
    README.Debian (closes: #167974).
  * Document interoperability problems between scp and ssh.com's server in

openssh (1:3.5p1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fixes typo in ssh-add usage (closes: #152239).
    - Fixes 'PermitRootLogin forced-commands-only' (closes: #166184).
    - ~/.ssh/environment and environment= options in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
      are deprecated for security reasons and will eventually go away. For
      now they can be re-enabled by setting 'PermitUserEnvironment yes' in
      sshd_config.
    - ssh-agent is installed setgid to prevent ptrace() attacks. The group
      actually doesn't matter, as it drops privileges immediately, but to
      avoid confusion the postinst creates a new 'ssh' group for it.
  * Obsolete patches:
    - Solar Designer's privsep+compression patch for Linux 2.2 (see
      1:3.3p1-0.0woody1).
    - Hostbased auth ssh-keysign backport (see 1:3.4p1-4).

  * Remove duplicated phrase in ssh_config(5) (closes: #152404).
  * Source the debconf confmodule at the top of the postrm rather than at
    the bottom, to avoid making future non-idempotency problems worse (see
    #151035).
  * Debconf templates:
    - Add Polish (thanks, Grzegorz Kusnierz).
    - Update French (thanks, Denis Barbier; closes: #132509).
    - Update Spanish (thanks, Carlos Valdivia Yagüe; closes: #164716).

    this is the selected ssh-askpass alternative (closes: #67775).

  * Since debian still relies on /etc/pam.d/ssh instead of moving to
    /etc/pam.d/sshd, I had to hack ssh.h to get ssh to use this name.
  * Fixed path to host key in sshd_config.

openssh (1:1.2.3-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * add version to libpam-modules dependency, because old versions of

  * typos in config (closes: #66779, #66780)

openssh (1:1.2.3-8) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * get rid of Provides: rsh-server (this will mean that rstartd
    will need to change it's depends to deal with #63948, which I'm
    reopening)  (closes: #66257)
    Given that this is also a trivial change, and is a reversal of a
    change that was mistakenly made after the freeze, I think this should
    also go into frozen.

 -- Philip Hands <phil@hands.com>  Wed, 28 Jun 2000 03:26:30 +0100

openssh (1:1.2.3-7) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * check if debconf is installed before calling db_stop in postinst.
    This is required to allow ssh to be installed when debconf is not
    wanted, which probably makes it an RC upload (hopefully the last of
    too many).

 -- Philip Hands <phil@hands.com>  Wed, 28 Jun 2000 03:19:47 +0100

openssh (1:1.2.3-6) frozen unstable; urgency=low

    grab vulnerability in ssh-askpass-gnome (closes: #64795) *RC*

  * add Provides: rsh-server to ssh (closes: #63948)

openssh (1:1.2.3-2) frozen  unstable; urgency=low

  * suggest debconf
  * conflict with debconf{,-tiny} (<<0.2.17) so I can clean up the preinst

openssh (1:1.2.3-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * patch sshd to create extra xauth key required for localhost
    (closes: #49944)  *** RC ***
  * FallbacktoRsh now defaults to ``no'' to match impression
    given in sshd_config
  * stop setting suid bit on ssh (closes: #58711, #58558)
    This breaks Rhosts authentication (which nobody uses) and allows
    the LD_PRELOAD trick to get socks working, so seems like a net benefit.

openssh (1:1.2.2-1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Integrated man page addition for PrintLastLog.
    This bug was filed on "openssh", and I ended up
    creating my own patch for this (closes: #59054)
  * Improved error message when ssh_exchange_identification
    gets EOF (closes: #58904)
  * Fixed typo (your -> you're) in debian/preinst.
  * Added else-clauses to config to make this upgradepath possible:
    oldssh -> openssh preinst fails due to upgrade_to_openssh=false
    -> ssh-nonfree -> openssh. Without these, debconf remembered
    the old answer, config didn't force asking it, and preinst always
    aborted (closes: #56596, #57782)
  * Moved setting upgrade_to_openssh isdefault flag to the place
    where preinst would abort. This means no double question to most
    users, people who currently suffer from "can't upgrade" may need
    to run apt-get install ssh twice. Did not do the same for 
    use_old_init_script, as the situation is a bit different, and
    less common (closes: #54010, #56224)
  * Check for existance of ssh-keygen before attempting to use it in
    preinst, added warning for non-existant ssh-keygen in config. This
    happens when the old ssh is removed (say, due to ssh-nonfree getting
    installed).

  * ssh-askpass-{gnome,ptk} now provide ssh-askpass, making ssh's
    Suggests: line more accurate. Also closing related bugs fixed
    earlier, when default ssh-askpass moved to /usr/bin.
    (closes: #52403, #54741, #50607, #52298, #50967, #51661)
  * Patched to call vhangup, with autoconf detection and all
    (closes: #55379)
  * Added --with-ipv4-default workaround to a glibc bug causing
    slow DNS lookups, as per UPGRADING. Use -6 to really use
    IPv6 addresses. (closes: #57891, #58744, #58713, #57970)
  * Added noenv to PAM pam_mail line. Thanks to Ben Collins.
    (closes: #58429)
  * Added the UPGRADING file to the package.
  * Added frozen to the changelog line and recompiled before
    package was installed into the archive.
